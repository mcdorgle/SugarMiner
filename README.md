# SugarMiner
pre-version not ready for use.

This is a freeware program for diabetics to easily monitor their blood sugar and insulin usage when not using a sliding scale and using an insulin to carb ratio. It lets the patient input their numbers and logs by date/time. I will also be working toward integrating this with Medtronic insulin systems and other bluetooth enabled blood glucose monitors. 

**Far ahead plans are to port this to iOs and Android
